/* ZS.Formation — formations as data (docs/SANGUO-DESIGN.md §4.4).

   Cannae bakes each unit's shape into its deployment; here a formation is a
   pure slot-offset generator the player can change mid-battle. Offsets are
   unit-local, in the same frame the Cannae slot seek already uses:

     +x = the unit's right,  +y = the unit's facing (forward)

   so `_seekSlot` rotating by the unit heading is unchanged.

   `assign()` re-solves which man stands in which slot. It runs whenever the
   formation changes or the unit's count drops enough to leave holes — greedy
   nearest-first, which is O(n·k) but only on re-solve, never per frame, and
   gives visibly sensible movement (nobody crosses the whole block to reach a
   slot someone else was standing next to). */
