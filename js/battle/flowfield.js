/* ZS.FlowField — group movement without per-agent A* (docs/SANGUO-DESIGN.md §4.4).

   `ZS.Nav.astar` is a fine path for one man and a terrible one for two hundred
   moving to the same place: the same search, two hundred times, against a
   shared per-frame budget. A flow field inverts it — one Dijkstra pass *from*
   the destination over the whole walkable grid, after which every cell already
   knows which way is downhill. A unit reads its own cell and steers; the
   existing separation pass keeps the crowd from stacking.

   One pass costs a few ms on a 160x120 grid and happens only when a unit is
   given a new destination, not per frame. `ZS.Nav.astar` stays for single
   generals and edge routing.

   Fields share the nav grid's 20 px cells, so `nav.isWalkable` is the only
   passability opinion in the system.

     const ff = new ZS.FlowField(nav);
     ff.build(goalX, goalY);
     ff.sample(x, y, out);   // out.x, out.y = unit vector downhill; false if unreachable
     ff.distAt(x, y);        // path cost to the goal, or Infinity

   Obstacle-heavy scenarios may opt into the other Nav collision mask and a
   deterministic traversal-cost grid without changing the default:

     const ff = new ZS.FlowField(nav, {
       collisionMask: true,  // floors / intact doors are blocked
       moveCost,             // Uint8Array, 10 = ordinary ground
     }); */

  "use strict";

  const INV = 1 / Math.SQRT2;

         - Sizing it `n + 1` drops pushes on the floor. This is
           decrease-key-by-reinsertion, so a cell is pushed once per improving
           edge; the bound is edges, not cells, and a typed array silently
           ignores out-of-range writes. It grows on demand instead (the live
           frontier is small, so in practice it never does).
         - Keying entries by reading `cost[cell]` at compare time re-keys
           entries that are *already in the heap* the moment a shorter path to
           that cell is found. The ordering silently breaks, cells settle at
           the wrong cost, and whole regions of the map stop expanding. The key
