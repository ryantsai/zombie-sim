/* SCENARIO PACK: the outbreak
 *
 * Everything scenario-specific lives here: who the agents are, how they
 * look, move, talk, fight, bleed, and how a round plays out. The core
 * engine (js/*.js) knows nothing about zombies — it runs the clock,
 * physics, spacing, navigation, camera, and rendering pipeline, and calls
 * this pack for the parts a scenario decides.
 *
 * To build a different scenario (an ancient battlefield, a modern one,
 * a fantasy skirmish...), copy this file, swap the script tag in
 * zombiesim.html, and reimplement the same surface:
 *
 *   attachStains(st)                        register splat/corpse painters
 *   makeAgent(x, y, st, extra)              agent record (core fields + yours)
 *   hostile(a)                              true -> AI runs first (A* budget)
 *   walkBlocked(a)                          true -> interiors/doors are solid
 *   maxSpeed(a)                              per-agent speed cap
 *   frame(agents, dt, t, grid)              once per frame, before the AI pass
 *   update(a, dt, t, grid, nav, world, buildings, wave)   per-agent AI
 *   init(agents, world, vw, vh, wave)       start a round
 *   maintain(agents, dt, world, vw, vh)     between rounds (reinforcements)
 *   left(agents)                            "players" still standing (0 -> new round)
 *   counts(agents)                           stats for the HUD
 *   tap(agents, world, x, y)                 what a pointer tap does
 *   hud(agents, wave)                        { title, stats, hint, legend(c,y,fs), overlay() }
 *   draw(c, a, t)                            one agent, all of it
 *   drawFX(c, fx)                            transient effect records
 *
 * Core-owned agent fields: x y vx vy a st seed gait id wantMove dead
 * path pi gx gy navV0 planFailT stuckT wx wt px py bld, plus the
 * presentation lifetimes flash and sayT (decayed by the core). A speech
 * bubble shows while a.say is set and a.sayT > 0 (a.sayMax = total time).
 * Transient effects are pushed onto this.fx as records carrying t (the
 * core decays and prunes them): tracers { x0,y0,x1,y1,t }, poofs
 * { x,y,t,poof,seed }, grenade arcs { x0,y0,x1,y1,t,grn,seed }, booms
 * { x,y,t,boom,seed }, ground fire { x,y,t,gfire,seed }, and blood
 * { x,y,t,blood,seed }.
