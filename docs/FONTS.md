## LXGW WenKai TC — 霞鶩文楷 台灣繁體

The game's brush-kai face (`SANGUO-DESIGN.md` §6.3).

| | |
|---|---|
| Upstream | <https://github.com/lxgw/LxgwWenkaiTC> |
| Version | v1.522 (`LXGWWenKaiTC-Regular.ttf`, 25 764 glyphs, ~15 MB) |
| Licence | SIL Open Font License 1.1 — full text in [`OFL.txt`](../fonts/OFL.txt) |

### What is committed here

`lxgw-wenkai-tc.subset.woff2` — a glyph subset of the Regular weight, cut to
exactly the characters the game can render (1,018 of them as of P3, ~285 KB).
The full font is far too large to ship, and the game's vocabulary is bounded,
so `tools/subset-font.py` harvests every character in every file that can put
text on screen and cuts the font to those.

**That list is maintained by hand**, in `TEXT_GLOBS` at the top of the script,
and it is the whole correctness of this system. It covers the string tables,
the campaign content, the art modules that draw Han characters directly
(`js/art/*.js`, `js/figure/*.js` — a flag's house glyph, a general's name), the
UI, the sanguo scenario, and `index.html`. Between P7 and P3 it did *not* cover
the art modules, and 120 glyphs the game drew on every page silently fell back
to system kai while `--check` reported the subset complete. **A new module that
draws a Han character must be added to `TEXT_GLOBS`, or the gate passes while
the page is wrong** (`ISSUES.md` #2).

The same bytes are also committed as `js/fonts/subset-data.js`, a `data:` URI.
That exists because a `@font-face` whose `src` is a `file://` URL is a
CORS-mode fetch from an opaque origin and browsers refuse it — without the
data URI, a double-clicked `index.html` would silently drop to system kai.
`js/fonts/font.js` tries both and reports which won via `ZS.Fonts.via`.

### Rebuilding

Whenever any harvested file gains new text, new glyphs fall outside the subset
and quietly render in the fallback face. Check with:

```bash
python tools/subset-font.py --check
```

To rebuild, download the source face from the upstream release page above and:

```bash
python tools/subset-font.py --source /path/to/LXGWWenKaiTC-Regular.ttf
```

The source `.ttf` is **not** committed — only the subset is. `test/sanguo-p0.js`
runs `--check` as part of the P0 suite, so `npm test` covers it.
