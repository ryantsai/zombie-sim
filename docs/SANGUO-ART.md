# 火柴三國 — the art system (SANGUO-ART)

The visual contract for the 火柴三國 page. Covers the **unit/figure
system**, the **flag system**, the **environment catalogue**, the
**UI art**, and the **portraits** — every picture the game draws, plus
how to add more.

The look is the boil line (§Hard constraints in `AGENTS.md`):
wobbly ink on a paper palette, re-jittered ~7x/second. Every art
piece is drawn through `ZS.sketch` (`wline`, `wcirc`, `wpoly`,
`sketchRect`, `lerpC`) and `ZS.boilText`. Nothing is pre-baked; the
same call drawn twice is the same picture, and the `seed` keeps the
wobble stable per render.

| Module | What it draws | Read first if you need… |
|---|---|---|
| `js/figure/figure.js` | the stickman baseline + 12 unit types + rank marks | …to add a new unit type or change a silhouette |
| `js/figure/portrait.js` | procedural headshot portraits of all 200 generals | …a general's face in the roster or after-action card |
| `js/art/flag.js` | flags — chrome (frame) + text (mark) as independent parts | …a faction banner, a province chip, or a planted battle marker |
| `js/art/environment.js` | trees, hills, rivers, camps, walls, gates, bridges, ruins, roads | …the look of a battle field or a campaign map |
| `js/art/ui.js` | the menu's title banner, save-slot thumbnails, button glyphs | …a new chrome icon or save-slot art |

The other three pages (`zombiesim.html`, `battle.html`, `hold.html`)
do not load any of these. The art system is 火柴三國-only.

---

## 1. The unit / figure system (`js/figure/figure.js`)

The matchstick figure is the primitive behind every human unit. One body;
the **weapon, armour, and stance** carry the type read. Siege equipment and
war elephants are explicit footprint-scale exceptions, still drawn entirely
from the same sketch primitives.

### 1.1 The baseline (`drawFoot`)

A unit is anchored at `(a.x, a.y)` = the point between the feet, ~20 px
tall at scale 1, drawn with:

- a ground shadow (a `wcirc` at `rgba(40,35,25,0.14)`)
- two `wline` legs that swing with the gait
- a `wline` torso
- a small faction-coloured `wpoly` cuirass over the torso
- a `wcirc` head with one eye dot on the forward side
- a `wline` arm + the type's weapon (see §1.3)
- a `wcirc` ground anchor

Every part takes `a.seed + <fixed offset>` as its wobble seed, so a
unit's silhouette is stable per render — the lines don't redraw
randomly from frame to frame.

The rider variant (`drawRider`) is the same armoured body on a 4-legged
wobbly horse. The two equipment variants (`drawCatapult` and `drawRam`)
replace the stickman with a faction-trimmed wobbly wagon; the standard
bearer (`drawStandard`) keeps the body and swaps the weapon for a tall
pole with a faction cloth. `drawElephant` is the intentional scale
exception: its broad body, howdah, blanket, tusks, and trunk are the unit read.

### 1.2 Rank tiers (§7.4)

A `tier` field on the agent scales ordinary bodies. Trooper through officer
reuse the same foot/rider drawing; a named general deliberately switches to
the catalogue's mounted hero recipe at 1.5×.

| Tier | Scale | Marks added on the marks layer |
|---|---|---|
| 兵 TROOPER | 1.00 | — |
| 什長 / 隊長 NCO | 1.05 | a small `wpoly` flag on the back |
| 校尉 OFFICER | 1.12 | flag + a coloured `wline` sash across the torso |
| 將 GENERAL | **1.50** | always-mounted hero model + sash + **aura ring** (`wcirc` at the faction colour, radius from `tong`) + **name banner** (a vertical pole + `wpoly` cloth with the general's name boiled on it) |

`drawMarks` is the layer that adds all of the above. The scenario draws either
`drawFoot` / `drawRider`, or `drawGeneral` for a named general, then decorates
that body with `drawMarks`.

### 1.3 Unit types (§7.3)

| Type | id | Weapon | Stance tweak |
|---|---|---|---|
| 槍兵 spear | `SPEAR = 0` | long `wline`, ~14 px, angled up at rest, level in the thrust | tight rank spacing (`sepR` low) |
| 刀盾 sword & shield | `DAO = 1` | short `wline` blade + `wcirc` / `wpoly` shield on the off-arm | — |
| 弩兵 crossbow | `BOW = 2` | short horizontal `wline` + tick; a physical bolt on shot | halts to fire |
| 戟兵 halberd | `JI = 3` | `wline` + a small cross `wline` near the tip | anti-cav bonus |
| 騎兵 cavalry | `CAV = 4` | rider body on a horse (reuses `_drawCav`) + lance | fast, wedge default |
| 弓騎 horse archer | `HBOW = 5` | cav body + bow tick | kite |
| 投石車 catapult | `CATAPULT = 6` | the stickman is replaced by a wobbly A-frame on two wheels, an arm angled up, a counterweight, a stone | — |
| 衝車 battering ram | `RAM = 7` | the stickman is replaced by a wobbly shed on wheels, a long log hanging from the front, a metal head | — |
| 旗手 standard bearer | `STANDARD = 8` | the personal weapon is replaced by a tall pole carrying the faction's flag cloth | the flag carries the faction's read |
| 虎豹騎 tiger/leopard cavalry | `HUBAO = 9` | heavy rider armour, horse stripes, helmet plume, couched lance | fastest wedge charge |
| 諸葛弩 repeating crossbow | `ZHUGE = 10` | crossbow stock, box magazine, and animated pump lever | rapid fire, short minimum range |
| 象兵 war elephant | `ELEPHANT = 11` | large elephant, four walking legs, blanket, howdah, tusks, swinging trunk | slow heavy charge and strong knockback |

The `drawFoot` function dispatches on `a.type`: equipment and elephant types
(`CATAPULT`, `RAM`, `ELEPHANT`) take the whole body; the standard bearer
(`STANDARD`) keeps the stickman and swaps the weapon.

### 1.4 The faction colour ramp (§7.2)

Eight colours, assigned at campaign start; the player faction always
takes slot 0. Reused as a low-alpha wash plus the ink line — armour,
shield, barding, equipment trim, sash, name-banner cloth, province fill,
and flag cloth. The simulator fixes slot 0 劉 to green and slot 1 曹 to blue.

```
green rgba(64,132,74) · blue rgba(70,96,150) · red rgba(150,54,44) ·
ochre rgba(150,120,60) · violet rgba(120,80,140) · teal rgba(60,130,130) ·
brown rgba(120,86,60) · slate rgba(96,104,120)
```

`ZS.figure.wash(i, alpha)` returns the wash string for any ramp entry
at the requested alpha. The flag system has its own wider palette
(`ZS.flag.NAMED`) — see §2.6.

### 1.5 Adding a new unit type

1. Add the constant to the type block at the top of `js/figure/figure.js`.
2. Add a `drawXxx(c, a)` function that follows the §1.1 anchor contract
   (`a.x`, `a.y` is between the feet).
3. Branch in `drawFoot` on `a.type` to dispatch to your drawer (see the
   `CATAPULT` / `RAM` / `ELEPHANT` precedent for "replace the whole body" and the
   `STANDARD` precedent for "keep the body, swap the weapon").
4. Tune the per-type stats in `js/scenarios/sanguo.js` (`HP`, `REACH`,
   `DMG`, `SPD`, etc.).
5. Add the i18n key (`battle.type.xxx`) to `js/i18n/{zh-tw,en}.js`.
6. Rebuild the font subset with `python tools/subset-font.py --source
   LXGWWenKaiTC-Regular.ttf` if your type label has new glyphs.

---

## 2. The flag system (`js/art/flag.js`)

Flags are a small generative system. A flag is **two independent record
fields** — `text` (the inscription) and `chrome` (the outer frame) —
and the system renders any combination of them.

```
flag = {
  text:   { char: '蜀', style: 'bold', color: 'rgb(61,52,43)' },
  chrome: { shape: 'swallowtail', border: 'double', pole: true,
            tassels: 2, color: [64, 132, 74] }
}
ZS.flag.draw(c, flag, x, y, w, h, t)
```

The draw call fills the cloth, draws the border, plants the pole,
hangs the tassels, writes the text — all from the data. No image is
loaded; no asset is pre-baked.

### 2.1 The text layer

`text` is a single CJK character (the inscription) plus a render
style:

| `style` | What it draws |
|---|---|
| `bold` (default) | a big character that fills the cloth, in `text.color` (defaults to ink). Used by all presets. |
| `plain` | a smaller character, centred, in ink. |
| `seal` | a small red stamp at the bottom-right corner with the character in white. |

The character is rendered with `ZS.boilText`, so the same call wobbles
in step with the rest of the boil.

### 2.2 The chrome layer

`chrome` is the outer frame:

| Field | Values | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `shape` | `rect` / `shield` / `square` / `swallowtail` / `round` / `pennant` / `diamond` | `rect` |
| `border` | `none` / `thin` / `double` | `thin` |
| `pole` | boolean — vertical pole on the left edge with a finial | `false` |
| `tassels` | 0 / 1 / 2 — bottom-corner tassels (a cord + bead + threads) | 0 |
| `sash` | a colour `[r, g, b]` — draws a horizontal stripe through the middle | — |
| `color` | the cloth fill (an `[r, g, b]` tuple) | — |

The seven shapes (the meaningful vocabulary for ancient Chinese
banners):

- **rect** — the flat rectangle. Most common.
- **shield** — a heraldic shield (rounded top, pointed bottom).
- **square** — a compact square; the "seal" feel.
- **swallowtail** — a banner with a deep V cut at the bottom.
- **round** — a circular roundel.
- **pennant** — a long, narrow triangle. For fast cavalry.
- **diamond** — a lozenge. For special units / general markers.

### 2.3 The eight chrome presets

`ZS.flag.CHROME` carries the canonical combinations a campaign or
battle usually wants:

| Preset | shape | border | pole | tassels | feel |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `plain` | rect | thin | yes | 0 | small flat banner |
| `banner` | rect | thin | yes | 2 | standard banner with corner tassels |
| `shield` | shield | double | no | 0 | the personal flag of a general |
| `great` | swallowtail | double | yes | 2 | the state banner (the big ceremonial one) |
| `seal` | square | thin | no | 0 | a compact square seal |
| `round` | round | thin | yes | 0 | a roundel |
| `pennant` | pennant | none | yes | 0 | a cavalry pennant |
| `diamond` | diamond | thin | no | 0 | a special-unit lozenge |

The presets are layered with `Object.assign` against a `{color}` field
to produce a flag instance — exactly the same pattern as the
`{text, chrome}` split.

### 2.4 The preset catalogue

`ZS.flag.PRESETS` is the named catalogue: 94 entries at last count.
Three groups:

- **3 kingdoms** — `shu` 蜀, `wei` 魏, `wu` 吳 (state names, on the
  `great` chrome).
- **Major families** — `liu` 劉, `cao` 曹, `sun` 孫, `yuan` 袁, `lv` 呂,
  `ma` 馬, `gongsun` 公, `tao` 陶, `hua` 華, `zhang` 張, `wang` 王,
  `kong` 孔, `yan_f` 嚴, `han_f` 韓, `dong` 董 (family names).
- **194 CE warlord roster** — 22 personal flags, one per warlord
  (`liu_bei` 備, `cao_cao` 操, `sun_quan` 權, …, `yan_baihu` 虎).
- **Generals** — 34 entries covering the major rosters of each
  kingdom (Wei: 16, Wu: 8, Shu: 10). The second character of the
  given name is the inscription (`xiahou_dun` 惇, `guan_yu` 羽, …).
- **13 Han provinces** — `yi` 益, `jing` 荊, `liang` 涼, `ji` 冀,
  `yang` 揚, `you` 幽, `yan` 兗, `xu` 徐, `yu` 豫, `bing` 并,
  `qing` 青, `jiao` 交, `si` 司.
- **Imperial + rebellion** — `han_imperial` 漢, `huang_jin` 巾,
  `tian_gong` 天, `yi_jiao` 義, `zei` 賊.

### 2.5 Public API

```

#### `forFaction(factionId)` — the campaign-pick panel

The figure module's 8-slot `FACTIONS` ramp maps to a flag here. Same id,
same colour in the stickman sash and the flag — the campaign pick
panel, the save-slot thumbnail, the in-battle STANDARD unit all read
from the same place.

#### `plant(c, flag, x, y, h, t)` — in-world markers

`x, y` is the **base of the pole** (where it meets the ground), `h` is
the total height. The pole is 78% of `h`; the flag is the upper 22%.
A ground shadow anchors the base. Used by:

- the battle view, to mark a deployment zone or a captured position
- the campaign map, to flag a held city or province
- the after-action card, to anchor the result line

#### `bearer(flag, x, y, opts)` — battle unit factory

Returns a STANDARD unit spec carrying the given flag. The scenario's
`init` / `maintain` still owns the agents array — this just produces
the record to push.

```
opts: { faction?, tier?, seed?, team? }
returns: { x, y, type: 8 (STANDARD), tier, faction, flag, seed, … }
```

The figure's `drawStandard` checks `a.flag`; if set, the cloth is
rendered through the full `ZS.flag.draw` (shape, color, text); if not,
it falls back to the original generic faction sash. Backwards
compatible with every existing STANDARD unit.

### 2.6 The colour palette

`ZS.flag.NAMED` carries 30+ `[r, g, b]` tuples, wider than the
figure's 8-slot `FACTIONS` ramp because the campaign has more than
8 factions. The figure's stickman sash still reuses the 8-colour
ramp; flags get their own.

```
shu / liu:           [64, 132, 74]    green
wei / cao:          [150, 54, 44]    red

### 2.7 Adding a new flag preset

1. Pick the character (state, family, given-name second char, or
   region).
2. Pick the colour — add it to `ZS.flag.NAMED` if it's new.
3. Pick the chrome — use one of the 8 `ZS.flag.CHROME` presets, or
   build a `{shape, border, pole, tassels, color}` directly.
4. Add the entry to `ZS.flag.PRESETS`:
   ```js
   my_new_flag: _mk("新", NAMED.my_color, "shield"),
   ```
5. Use it: `ZS.flag.draw(c, ZS.flag.get("my_new_flag"), ...)`.

To map it to a figure.FACTIONS id (for the campaign pick panel),
extend `ZS.flag.forFaction` with a new `case` if it should be a player
faction.

## 3. Environment art (`js/art/environment.js`)

Reusable world pieces, all drawn through the same primitives. Used by
the campaign map (where they paint the paper Han) and the battle field
(where they dress the open country / fort / town kinds).

| Function | What it draws | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `tree(c, x, y, r, kind, seed)` | `kind` = `pine` / `oak` / `plum`; `random` chooses | campaign map |
| `pine(c, x, y, r, seed)` | the conical 松 — three triangle layers | campaign map |
| `oak(c, x, y, r, seed)` | a broad 槐 — overlapping foliage blobs | campaign map |
| `plum(c, x, y, r, seed)` | a wobbly 梅 with pink blossoms | campaign map |
| `rock(c, x, y, r, seed)` | a boulder with cracks | campaign map / fort wall |
| `hill(c, x, y, w, h, seed)` | a low hill with a few trees on the ridge | campaign map |
| `river(c, points, w, seed)` | a polyline waterway with a wash + a current line + ripples | campaign map |
| `pond(c, x, y, r, seed)` | a circular pond (river oxbow, lake) | campaign map |
| `camp(c, x, y, w, h, faction, seed)` | a tent camp (3 tents + central banner) | campaign map / fort |
| `wall(c, x1, y1, x2, y2, hp, seed)` | a crenellated wall segment, hp-aware cracks | fort field |
| `gate(c, x, y, w, seed)` | a closed gate with a centre seam + studs | fort field |
| `bridge(c, x, y, w, seed)` | a small wooden bridge with planks | campaign map |
| `ruins(c, x, y, r, seed)` | a small ruined building — broken walls + fallen pillar | campaign map |
| `road(c, points, w, seed)` | a worn dirt road with a centre cart track | campaign map |

`ZS.env.wash(i, a)` is the same wash helper as the figure module,
mirrored so the module is self-sufficient.

---

## 4. UI art (`js/art/ui.js`)

Chrome that doesn't live in the world. Reused by the menu, the
settings panel, the load-game panel, the after-action card.

| Function | What it draws |
|---|---|
| `banner(c, faction, x, y, w, h, seed)` | a small vertical faction banner — pole + finial + cloth + a single "seal" mark |
| `saveThumb(c, x, y, w, h, faction, seed)` | a small landscape: a hill + trees + the player's banner flying |
| `iconBattle(c, x, y, size, seed)` | sword + shield glyph — the **battle** button |
| `iconCampaign(c, x, y, size, seed)` | a scroll glyph — the **campaign** button |
| `iconFlag(c, x, y, size, seed)` | a flag glyph — the **factions** button |
| `iconMusic(c, x, y, size, seed, on)` | a quaver note (or with a slash through it when off) — the **music** toggle |
| `seal(c, x, y, size, seed)` | a red stamp — a brushy ink mark inside a square frame |
| `tally(c, x, y, h, count, seed)` | a group of vertical strokes bundled by fives (with a slash) — troop counts |
| `titleBanner(c, cx, baseY, size, titleW, t)` | the menu's big cloth banner behind the title — two poles + cloth + woven hatches + a sway |

---

## 5. Portraits (`js/figure/portrait.js`)

A small system for the headshot portraits of all 200 almanac generals,
drawn at 60–120 px. Used outside the battle — the menu's
"Choose your warlord" panel, the after-action card, the save-slot
icon, the campaign roster.

### 5.1 The vocabulary

Each portrait is a combination of:

- **headgear** — the common `turban` / `crown` / `helmet` / `band`, plus hero
  silhouettes such as `hood`, `scholar`, `silver_helmet`, `horn_helmet`,
  `phoenix`, `yellow_turban`, `feather_crown`, and `ornate_crown`.
- **beard** — `long` (the famous 關羽 / 張飛 long beard), `chin` (a
  shorter scholarly one), `goatee` (a small tuft), `moustache` (a
  sweeping Cao Cao style).
- **expression** (a `cue` string) — `kind`, `calm`, `regal`, `stern`,
  `fierce`, `angry`, `clever`, `scheming`, `proud`, `pompous`, `bold`,
  `wild`, `aged`, `scholarly`. The expression drives the brow tilt and
  any extra marks (a scar for `wild` / `aged`).

Features such as 關羽's red face, 劉備's long ears, 夏侯惇's eye patch,
孫權's jade eyes, white brows, ribbons and forehead seals add one more readable
stroke without abandoning the shared body. All pieces take a deterministic `seed` (hashed from the general's
name) so the portrait is stable per render.

### 5.2 The catalogue

The catalogue is `ZS.Generals.ALL`: exactly 200 commonly recognised historical
and Romance/Sangokushi figures across Shu, Wei/Jin, Wu, Han warlords, the
Yellow Turbans and southern powers. Every record owns four base stats, skills,
equipment ids, a portrait recipe and a mounted 1.5× battlefield model. Thirty-
eight story-famous figures have hand-authored appearance recipes; the rest use
role-aware deterministic combinations from the same visual vocabulary.

`ZS.portrait.get(id)` returns the record. `ZS.portrait.draw(c, g, x,
y, w, h, t)` draws the headshot.

### 5.3 Adding a new portrait

1. Add a source row to `js/campaign/data/generals.js`. The almanac builds the
   portrait and model recipes automatically; use `ICONIC` only when a known
   story silhouette needs hand-authored treatment:
   ```js
   ["my_general", "名", "Name", "字", "Zi", "shu",
     80, 80, 70, 60, "strategist"]

   ICONIC.my_general = [
     "crown", "long", "scholarly", // portrait
     "feather_fan", "white", "blue", "crane_robe" // field model
   ];
   ```
2. Run `node tools/check-generals.js`, then use it with
   `ZS.portrait.draw(c, ZS.portrait.get("my_general"), ...)`.

---

## 6. Integration patterns

### 6.1 The campaign-pick panel

```js
// show the 8 possible starting factions
for (let fid = 0; fid < 8; fid++) {
  const f = ZS.flag.forFaction(fid);
  // f is the canonical flag for that faction slot
  ZS.flag.draw(c, f, panelX + col * 200, panelY, 180, 220, t);
}
```

### 6.2 The campaign map — province chip

```js
// each province has a bannerKey; the campaign data stores the
// preset name in its record
const provFlag = ZS.flag.get(province.bannerKey);  // e.g. "jing"
ZS.flag.draw(c, provFlag, provX, provY, 40, 30, t);
```

### 6.3 The battle — deployment zone marker

```js
// at the start of a battle, plant the player's flag at the back
// of their deployment area
ZS.flag.plant(
  c,
  ZS.flag.forFaction(scenario.player),
  1000, 600, 80, t
);
```

### 6.4 The battle — flag-wielding unit

```js
// a STANDARD unit carrying the faction's flag; the scenario's
// init / maintain still owns the agents array
const standard = ZS.flag.bearer(
  ZS.flag.get("wei"),
  unitX, unitY,
  { faction: 1, tier: 3, team: 0 }
);
scenario.agents.push(standard);
```

### 6.5 The after-action card

```js
// the loser's flag, drooped, on the result line
const losFlag = ZS.flag.get(loserFaction.bannerKey);
ZS.flag.plant(c, losFlag, cardX, cardY, 60, t);
```

### 6.6 The menu — title banner

`ZS.uiArt.titleBanner(c, cx, baseY, size, titleW, t)` — the menu
view calls this; the cloth is bigger and more layered than the
`banner()` chrome. The `t` parameter drives a small sway.

---

## 7. The contract with the rest of the engine

- **Nothing here loads external assets.** All drawing is procedural;
  the boil look is the look, no images, no sprite sheets, no fetched
  SVGs. This is the file:// contract (§Hard constraints in
  `AGENTS.md`).
- **No per-frame allocation in hot loops.** The catalogue data is
  shared; the only per-frame allocation is the wrapper object the
  `draw*` functions receive as arguments. The figure pipeline
  (re-using `wline` / `wcirc` / `wpoly`) and the flag pipeline
  (re-using `drawStandard` + `ZS.flag.draw`) both follow the rule.
- **Format with oxfmt, lint with oxlint.** Both must be clean. Run
  before finishing any change. From non-TTY automation, call the
  bins directly (`node node_modules/oxfmt/bin/oxfmt js/art js/figure`
  and `node node_modules/oxlint/bin/oxlint js/art js/figure`).
- **Re-run the font subset when glyphs change.** If you add a new
  character to any i18n key or to a portrait / flag catalogue entry
  that isn't already in the LXGW WenKai TC subset, the missing glyph
  silently falls back to system kai. Run
  `python tools/extend-subset.py` to patch the subset in place
  (stopgap) or `python tools/subset-font.py --source
