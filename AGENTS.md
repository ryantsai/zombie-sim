# AGENTS.md — The Outbreak (sketch zombie sim)

A hand-drawn, "boiling line" sketch-style sim. Four HTML pages share one
core: `index.html` (火柴三國 / Matchstick Three Kingdoms, a turn-based campaign
RPG wrapped around real-time battles — design in docs/SANGUO-DESIGN.md, the art
system in docs/SANGUO-ART.md, build status in docs/PROGRESS.md, open items in
docs/ISSUES.md), `zombiesim.html` (the outbreak, a zombie horde in a paper
town), `battle.html` (Cannae, 216 BC, 781-figure battle), and `hold.html`
(The Hold, a tile-based zombie clicker — design in docs/HOLD-DESIGN.md). Vanilla
JS, Canvas 2D. No framework, no build step, no bundler — and it must stay
that way (see Hard constraints).

`index.html` is the entry point; the other three are the earlier sims and are
still live. The load order below is theirs — 火柴三國 has its own (it boots a
shell before any world exists), described in its section further down.

## Run it

Double-click any of them (file:// protocol), or serve the
directory with any static server. That's the whole build. `package.json`
scripts are dev tooling only (format/lint).

## Hard constraints

1. **Must stay double-clickable (file://).** All code is classic
   `<script src>` tags + IIFEs sharing one `window.ZS` namespace. **No ES
   modules** (CORS-blocked on file://), no imports, no build output.
2. **The style is the product.** Everything is drawn with the sketch
   primitives in `js/sketch.js` (wobbly lines that re-jitter every 140 ms —
   the "boil"). New visuals must use those primitives and the paper palette.
   Landscape may carry subtle color washes; the ink line work stays.
3. **Agent look/animation is frozen.** The agent drawing
   (`ScenarioZombie.draw` in `js/scenarios/zombie.js`) is a verbatim port of
   the original in `example/index.html`. Do not restyle it. If a feature
   needs new agent visuals, ask first.
4. **`example/index.html` is the reference original** (pre-split, single
   file). Behavior and numbers were ported from it; keep it untouched and
   use it to resolve "what was the original way?" questions.
5. **No per-frame allocations in hot loops** (910 agents). Reuse arrays and
   records; decay-and-prune instead of rebuild.
6. **Format with oxfmt, lint with oxlint** (Oxc tooling). Run before
   finishing any change; both must be clean (0 warnings/errors).

## Architecture

Two layers, one contract between them:

zombiesim.html / battle.html / hold.html  (same load order, page var line differs)
└── <script> load order (matters):
    <script>var ZS_SCEN = "ScenarioCannae";</script>   ← battle.html only
    <script>var ZS_WW=1600; var ZS_WH=1200; var ZS_SCEN="ScenarioHold";</script> ← hold.html only
    js/sketch.js        style primitives (boil, wline, wcirc, wpoly, lerpC…)
    js/grid.js          spatial hash
    js/nav.js           A* pathfinding + walkability mask
    js/camera.js        pan/zoom/pinch camera, clamped to the world
    js/world.js         paper world (3200×2400 default; a page may set
                        ZS_WW/ZS_WH before the tags), water, forest, pre-render
    js/buildings.js     procedural town (rooms, doors, occupancy)
    js/stains.js        generic persistent-stamp layer (splats, corpses)
    js/tiles.js         optional square ground grid (the Hold): nav marking + sketch render
    js/agents.js        generic entity engine (AI pass, separation, clamp)
    js/sim.js           game clock (rounds, reinforcements, tap)
    js/scenarios/zombie.js | cannae.js | hold.js   the SCENARIO PACK (contract below)
    js/draw.js          scene + HUD pipeline (calls back into the scenario)
    js/sound.js         WebAudio cues (sketch-quiet blips/booms + the formant
                        voice lines; unlocks on first pointerdown; the scenario
                        names the events)
    js/main.js          bootstrap: world, camera, input, main loop

**The core (`js/*.js`) knows nothing about zombies.** It runs the clock,
physics, spacing, navigation, camera, and rendering pipeline, and calls the
scenario for everything scenario-specific. **The scenario pack owns** who the
agents are, how they look, move, talk, fight, bleed, and how a round plays
out. A different scenario is a copy of a scenario pack plus a page that sets
`var ZS_SCEN` to the new class name (battle.html is the example).

### Frame flow

`main.js` loop (rAF, dt clamped to 50 ms):

1. `ZS.setBoil(t)` — advances the boil timer (line jitter epoch)
2. `ZS.Sim.update(dt, t, world, W, H)`:
   - if `scenario.left(agents) === 0` → after the town-fall beat
     (`scenario.beatT || 3` seconds, or immediately if the scenario sets
     `skipBeat`, consumed on the `wave++`), `wave++` and
     `scenario.init(...)` (new round); otherwise `scenario.maintain(...)`
     (edge reinforcements)
   - `ZS.updateAgents(agents, dt, t, world, wave)`:
     1. rebuild spatial grid; per-agent `id`, `flash`/`sayT` decay
     2. `scenario.frame(agents, dt, t, grid)` — scenario-wide logic
        (panic-by-voice propagation in the zombie pack)
     3. **two AI passes**: `scenario.hostile(a)` agents first (they get the
        A* budget), then the rest — each via `scenario.update(a, dt, t, grid,
        nav, world, buildings, wave)`
     4. door-shake + transient-fx decay
     5. **separation**: every unordered pair within `SEP_R` (18 px, or the
        scenario's optional `sepR` property — dense battle formations sit at
        slot spacing and would inflate at 18 px) gets a soft push; within
        `SEP_CORE` (10 px) a hard positional push (`corePush`, wall-aware)
     6. walkability fix-up (nobody ends inside a wall — or inside water
        unless the scenario sets `swim`), page margins, `scenario.maxSpeed(a)`
        cap (× `SWIM_FRAC` 0.25 while in water for swim-capable scenarios),
        integrate, stuck-timer, building occupancy (the `inCount`/`survCount`
        resets happen *after* the AI pass — the pass reads the previous
        frame's tallies, never zeroes; the refill happens during
        integration)
     7. dead / off-field compaction (dead or `a.gone` agents leave the array)
3. `ZS.drawScene(...)`: pre-rendered paper background → water → the
   scenario's `drawGround` pass (the Hold's tile washes) → stains →
   y-sorted trees/buildings/agents (`scenario.draw` per agent) →
   `scenario.drawFX` → speech bubbles → HUD from `scenario.hud(agents,
   wave)`. The scene list is culled to the camera, so **fps scales with how
   much world is visible** (fit view = whole world ≈ 40–50 fps; zoomed ≈
   display refresh).

### Core `ZS` surface

| export | what it is |
|---|---|
| `ZS.rnd, ZS.clamp, ZS.rng32, ZS.hash` | random/util (hash is deterministic) |
| `ZS.setBoil, ZS.jit, ZS.sjit` | boil epoch + per-seed jitter |
| `ZS.wline, ZS.wcirc, ZS.wpoly, ZS.sketchRect, ZS.lerpC` | sketch drawing |
| `ZS.Grid` | spatial hash (insert/query) |
| `ZS.Nav` | `isWalkable(x,y,isZ)`, `isWater(x,y)`, `astar(x1,y1,x2,y2,isZ,maxExpand,swim)`, `los(x1,y1,x2,y2,isZ,swim)`, `nearestWalkable`, `randLand`, `inForest`; `version` bumps when the map changes. The `swim` flag (from the scenario's `swim` property) makes water cells passable at 4x cost — the swim is taken only when it beats the detour; without it water is a hard block. `los` intermediate cells carry the ray's own mask (a zombie-side ray stops at intact doors/walls); the *endpoint* tests the human mask, so a ray that reaches a floor/door/land point is sightable from every side (broken doors pass both) |
| `ZS.World` | terrain, water, forest, pre-rendered paper, `trees`, `buildings`, `stains` |
| `ZS.Buildings` | town generator + `cellBldAt` occupancy lookup |
| `ZS.Stains` | persistent stamp canvas; `register(kind, painter)`, `splat`, `corpse`, `fillBlob` |
| `ZS.Tiles` | optional square ground grid (`set`, `stroke`, `drawAll`); water tiles hard-block the nav grid |
| `ZS.makeAgent` | core alias → `scenario.makeAgent` |
| `ZS.updateAgents` | the core per-frame entity pipeline (above) |
| `ZS.fx` | transient effect records (`{t}` — core decays/prunes) |
| `ZS.planAndFollow, ZS.wander, ZS.wanderTarget` | movement helpers for scenarios (A*-bounded steering) |
| `ZS.Camera` | `fit`, `zoom`, `x/y`, `clamp`, `toWorld`, `autoSeek(x, y, z, dt, vw, vh, ease)` — exponential chase, `ease` a time constant in seconds (default 0.7; the zombie pack passes its own) |
| `ZS.Sim` | `agents`, `wave`, `init`, `counts`, `update`, `tap` |
| `ZS.sound` | `event(name, x, y)`, `tick(dt)`, `unlocked` — WebAudio cues (no assets), spatialized against the camera, per-name cooldowns, unlocked on first pointerdown; event names owned by the scenario (zombie map: `shot_rifle/shot_shotgun/shot_smg/shot_gren/boom/moan/door_break/fire/turret/horn` + the formant voice lines `v_shout/v_gasp/v_mumble/v_laugh/v_grunt/v_callout/v_groan/v_growl/v_chomp/v_mama/v_spit/v_zedshout` — moving F1/F2/F3 bandpasses over a detuned double-saw glottis, ported 1:1 from `.verify/voices.html`; `moan` picks a random dark zombie line; `boom` is a full phrase: soft-clipped shock crack, falling bandpass body, saw sub, resonant rumble tail, debris, distant echo) |
| `ZS.drawScene` | the render pipeline |
| `ZS.scenario` | the live scenario pack instance |
| `ZS.debug` | `{ cam, world, nav, buildings, scenario }` — verification + future player/vehicle hook |

## The scenario contract

`ScenarioZombie` implements this surface (signatures verified in
`js/scenarios/zombie.js`; the file's header block is the canonical list):

| method | role |
|---|---|
| `attachStains(st)` | register splat/corpse painters (`st.register(kind, painter)`) |
| `terrain(world, nav)` | optional: lay your own battlefield instead of the random town (skips water/forest/town/trees); the Hold builds its tile grid here |
| `drawGround(c, world, t)` | optional: per-frame ground pass after water, before everything with height (the Hold's tile render) |
| `pointerDown/Move/Up(x, y)` | optional: claim a pointer gesture (true from `pointerDown` = the camera never pans for that pointer); the Hold's dig-drag |
| `makeAgent(x, y, st, extra)` | the agent record (core fields + scenario fields) |
| `hostile(a)` | true → AI updated first (A* budget priority) |
| `walkBlocked(a)` | true → building interiors/doors are solid for this agent |
| `maxSpeed(a)` | per-agent speed cap |
| `sepR` (property, optional) | this pack's separation radius (cannae: 13, packed ranks) |
| `swim` (property, optional) | true → water is a soft block: A* crosses river/lake/pond when the swim (4x cell cost) beats the detour, LOS sees across it, and in-water speed is capped at `SWIM_FRAC` 0.25 of `maxSpeed` (zombie pack only; cannae/hold stay hard-blocked — Hold's dug moats use tile water, which never enters the water mask) |
| `beatT` (property, optional) | town-fall beat in seconds (zombie: 4.5 — the dawn report card holds it up); core defaults to 3 |
| `skipBeat` (property) | set true to dismiss the town-fall beat early (consumed on the `wave++`); the zombie pack's tap on the dawn card |
| `paused` (property) | true → `Sim.update` returns early: the world waits (the Hold's results card; probe scripts use it to freeze the sim for deterministic camera tests) |
| `frame(agents, dt, t, grid, nav)` | once per frame, before the AI pass |
| `update(a, dt, t, grid, nav, world, buildings, wave)` | per-agent AI |
| `init(agents, world, vw, vh, wave)` | start a round (fills the array) |
| `maintain(agents, dt, world, vw, vh)` | between rounds (reinforcements) |
| `left(agents)` | "players" still standing; 0 → new round |
| `counts(agents)` | HUD stats (`surv, zomb, shel, guard`) |
| `tap(agents, world, x, y)` | what a pointer tap does (zombie: calls a sky-fall artillery strike, 8 s cooldown; while the town has fallen it dismisses the dawn card via `skipBeat`) |
| `hud(agents, wave)` | `{ title, stats, hint, legend(c, y, fs, vw, vh), overlay() }` — `vw`/`vh` optional (the zombie pack uses them for the threat arrow); `overlay()` may return `{ card }` for a sketched results card |
| `draw(c, a, t)` | one agent, all of it (frozen look) |
| `drawFX(c, fx)` | render transient effect records |
| `camInterest(dt)` | optional (CONTRACT B): what the auto-camera watches — `main.js` calls it every frame when defined and feeds `Camera.autoSeek`; return a `{x, y, zoom, ease?}` record (the zombie pack reuses a module-level `CI` record — no per-frame allocs) or null to hold still; the zombie pack eases a focal point to the heat-weighted centroid of hot zones (`h > 10`), zooms by their spread (1.45 / 1.15 / 0.95) and pulses on booms/grenades; drag, pinch or wheel input hands the camera back for the session — a tap doesn't (it's an action: sound unlock, the artillery call) |

**Core-owned agent fields** (don't clobber): `x y vx vy a st seed gait id
wantMove dead free gone path pi gx gy navV0 planFailT stuckT wx wt px py bld`,
presentation lifetimes `flash` and `sayT` (the core decays both). A speech
bubble shows while `a.say` is set and `a.sayT > 0` (`a.sayMax` = total time).
The scenario owns everything else on the record (`st` semantics, `gun`,
`inf`, `scareT`, `muzzle`, shelter/path state, …).

**Transient effects** are pushed onto `this.fx` (aliased to `ZS.fx` by
`main.js`) as records carrying `t`; the core decays and prunes them. Zombie
pack shapes: tracer `{x0,y0,x1,y1,t}`, poof `{x,y,t,poof,seed}`, blood
`{x,y,t,blood,seed}` (`blood` 1=bite, 2=rifle, 3=shotgun/kill).

## Zombie pack mechanics (the knobs live at the top of `js/scenarios/zombie.js`)

- **States**: `st` 0 = survivor, 1 = infected (turning, shivers, then
  zombie), 2 = zombie. `a.gun` + `st < 2` = guard (soldier behavior).
- **Water is a soft block** (`swim = true`): river/lake/pond cells pass
  `astar` at 4x cost and `los` outright, so a chase across the water swims
  the shortest crossing at `SWIM_FRAC` 0.25 speed (≈ 14-30 px/s) and a
  pack spawns/reaches a district on the far side of the river when no land
  route is cheaper. Walls, intact doors and building interiors are still
  hard blocks.
- **Population**: `baseCount = clamp(vw*vh/1100, 36, 910)`; `maintain`
  tops up to `baseCount + 8` with edge spawn wanderers.
- **Zombies** (`_updateZombie`): sight `PERC` 340 (`PERC_FOREST` 150 in tree
  cover), **gated on `nav.los(agent, prey, true)`** — no lock through walls
  or intact doors; chase last-known point for ~2.5 s after losing sight,
  touch-infect within `INFECT` 19 (bite chance → `st=1`), chew doors at
  `DOOR_DPS` 30. Packs gnawing a door inside an occupied house adopt the
  residents by **scent** (whole-town scan of `survCount > 0` houses with an
  intact door — the occupancy tallies the AI pass reads, see the frame
  flow) and convert them on breach.
- **Survivors** (`_updateSurvivor`): panic within `FLEE` 180 (also
  LOS-gated — a survivor doesn't spook on a zombie behind a wall), run to
  `_pickShelter` (scored `dist + inCount*600 + survCount*60` — a full house
  loses to an empty one next door), or panic-run with no shelter; panic
  also propagates by **voice** — shouts (`_tryShout`, capped at `SAY_MAX`
  simultaneous bubbles) spook survivors within `HEAR_R` even with no
  zombie in sight.
- **Defense corps** (`_updateDefender`): one squad per district (size 3–6,
  mix in `SQUAD_MIX`), an arc of slots facing the district's shared threat,
  fallback lines to the town core (`state` 1), one **door sentry** per
  district holding the nearest intact door, and a **turret** on the gap
  (`TURRET_HP` 8, contact damage) with its own **gunner**: an ordinary
  rifleman (`crewFor`) who walks to and holds the slot; the gun only
  fires while manned (crew alive, `st < 2`, within 120 px) and an
  unmanned emplacement is drawn dark. One soldier per district is
  quietly promoted to `wep="grenade"` (drawn like a rifleman — no
  special look) and throws at the district's crisis via `_grenadeThrow`
  (door pack first, else densest pack). FIGHTER civilians join as
  unattached `civ` gunners.
- **Rovers** (`ROVER_N` 4, `ROVER_SEE` 400): unattached riflemen spawned on
  open land at wave start. A zombie in `ROVER_SEE` closes to a 100px
  standoff and fires via the shared defender fire section; with no threat
  they work the district posts in turn (`rvI % squad count`, 5 s dwell).
  Same damage model as soldiers; they count in the `guard` tally.
- **In-wave escalation**: `waveAge` (seconds into the wave) grows pack
  size, shortens the spawn cadence, fires a once-per-wave **surge** at the
  weakest post after 60 s (`PACK_CAP + wave`, capped 22), and doubles pack
  spawns after 120 s. Horde size stays defense-dependent by design; the
  *pressure* escalates.
- **Fire respects walls**: every ignition path — the ground-fire tuft loop
  in `frame()`, burning-contact spread (`_updateBurning`), and the blast
  (`_boom`) — is gated on `nav.los(source, target, true)`. Walls and intact
  doors block fire; a broken door passes. All ignition rates are tuned
  self-limiting (a burn peak dies out in ~30 s; no town-wide chains).
- **Rounds**: when `left() === 0` the town has fallen; `frame()` latches
  `fell` (wave tally, doors held, the horde's press direction) and the
  HUD serves the **dawn report card** through `overlay()`; after the
  `beatT` 4.5 s beat the `wave` increments and `init` respawns (initial
  zombies `min(1 + floor(wave * 0.7), 6)`). A **tap calls a sky-fall
  artillery strike** (0.9 s grenade flight into the shared `_boom`, 8 s
  cooldown) — or, while the town is fallen, dismisses the card
  (`skipBeat`). The hint line and legend reflect both.
- **Separation constants** are core (`js/agents.js`): `SEP_R` 18, `SEP_CORE`
  10, `SEP_FORCE` 130, `CELL` 26, `NAV_BUDGET` 10 A* searches/frame.
  Expect min pairwise distance ~10 px in open ground and 7–8 px in crowded
  building interiors (walls block the hard push) — that's by design, not a
  bug.

## Cannae pack mechanics (`js/scenarios/cannae.js`)

- **Shape**: 781 figures (352 rome east, facing west; 429 carthage west,
  facing east). Every agent holds a slot in a formation whose centroid a
  per-unit step script drives (`HOLD/ADV/RET/CHARGE/DIS/SKIRM/ROUT`); combat
  is local (nearest enemy in reach), so the battle shape emerges from the
  scripts + morale + separation.
- **Choreography**: the carthaginian center deploys as a salient (bulged
  front), yields backward on contact, then wheels into a crescent that closes
  on the pressed roman center (`trigger1` = contact, `trigger2` = the roman
  center crossed into the pocket); Hasdrubal's heavy cav (south wing) and the
  Numidians (north wing) sweep around to the roman rear and strike the rout.
- **End condition**: the battle ends only on total annihilation —
  `sides[s].dead + sides[s].gone >= sides[s].total0`. Routed men set
  `a.free` (the core skips their margin/clamp) and stream to the nearest
  world edge; crossing the edge marks them `a.gone` (tallied in `frame`).
  Winner units whose scripts are exhausted hunt the nearest routed enemy until
  none remain (`HUNT_FRAC` 0.6), then hold the field when it is over.
- **Pacing knobs**: `UNIT_SPD` (heavy advance 40, cav 172 charge), `ATK_CD`
  0.75, `SLNG_R` 190, `EXIT_PAD` 30, `HUNT_R` 900. A full battle runs
  ~60-100 s; the check script asserts 45-180 s.

## 火柴三國 (`index.html`, design in `docs/SANGUO-DESIGN.md`, art in `docs/SANGUO-ART.md`, status in `docs/PROGRESS.md`)

A hybrid: a turn-based map-strategy RPG whose battles drop into the Cannae
engine in real time. It is the only page with a shell (`ZS.App`: MENU →
CAMPAIGN ↔ BATTLE → RESULT) and the only one that is bilingual.

P0 and P1 are done: the page boots to a menu, and **Skirmish** drops into a
commandable real-time battle. New top-level modules, all additive, none loaded
by the other three pages:

- **shell** — `js/app.js` (`ZS.App`, the view state machine), `js/ui/menu.js`,
  `js/text.js` (`ZS.boilText`, canvas type drawn per glyph on the boil)
- **persistence** — `js/store/*` (the `ZS.Store` seam + Local/Memory/Remote),
  `js/auth/auth.js` (anonymous `deviceId`, an OAuth seam for later),
  `js/save/save-manager.js` (schema, `migrateUp` chain, capture/apply,
  shadow→main→bak durability)
- **localization** — `js/i18n/*` (zh-tw default, en fallback), `js/fonts/*`
- **battle** — `js/scenarios/sanguo.js` (`ScenarioSanguo`), `js/figure/figure.js`
  (the §7 stickman baseline every unit is drawn through),
  `js/battle/flowfield.js` (Dijkstra group movement — no per-agent A* for a
  block move), `js/battle/formation.js` (formations as data),
  `js/battle/command.js` (selection, control groups, orders)

Verify: `npm test` — `test/sanguo-p0.js` (48), `test/sanguo-p1.js` (63),
`test/sanguo-p3.js` (131), the P4-P7 suites, `test/sanguo-campaign-ui.js` (25),
`test/pages-regression.js` (32), `test/hold-p4.js` (22), and
`tools/check-generals.js` (200). The
campaign UI suite guards the map *as an interface* — the warlord palette stays
separable (much more so where two of them share a border on the sheet), the
guide line and the tooltip track what is selected, and click-to-march and
drag-to-march give the same order without panning the map. The pages regression
exists to prove the core changes below did not disturb the original three
pages, and is the only thing that will tell you if they did.

**Core changes this page needed.** All opt-in, all no-ops elsewhere:

- `js/main.js` — the bootstrap is now `ZS.Engine.start(opts)` and auto-starts
  unless a page sets `window.ZS_MANUAL_BOOT`. The handle carries `stop()`
  (cancels the loop, removes every listener it added), `step(dt)` for headless
  runs, `speed` (0 = paused, up to 4x) and `fixedStep`. 火柴三國 needs it
  because its shell owns a MENU that exists before any battle, and rebuilds the
  battle each time one is fought.
- `js/draw.js` — the HUD face is `ZS.scenario.hudFont` when a pack sets one
  (this page draws Chinese chrome and wants the kai stack), and there is a new
  `scenario.drawWorld(c, t)` hook after `drawFX` that runs every frame whether
  or not effects are pending.
- `js/agents.js` — the exact-overlap separation nudge uses `ZS.hash` of the
  pair's ids instead of `Math.random()`. Just as arbitrary, now reproducible;
  it was the last thing keeping a fixed-seed battle from replaying identically.

**The battle is deterministic** from `(seed, armies, order log)`. There is no
bare `Math.random()` in the sim — the pack threads one seeded `ZS.rng32` — and
it runs on a fixed 1/30 s step, which is also what makes the active pause and
2x/4x free.

The page ships a brush-kai face — **LXGW WenKai TC (霞鶩文楷), SIL OFL 1.1** —
as a glyph subset cut to exactly the game's vocabulary (`fonts/`, licence and
rebuild instructions in `docs/FONTS.md`). It is committed twice: as a
`.woff2` for the `@font-face` rule, and as a `data:` URI in
`js/fonts/subset-data.js`, because a CORS-mode font fetch from a `file://`
opaque origin is refused and constraint 1 says the page must stay
double-clickable. **Re-run `python tools/subset-font.py --check` after adding
text anywhere `index.html` loads** — new glyphs fall back silently otherwise.

## Hold pack (`js/scenarios/hold.js`, design in `docs/HOLD-DESIGN.md`)

A sketch-style zombie clicker: one ring of soldiers on a 1600×1200 tile
world (40×30 of 40px tiles), day/economy → night/horde loop. P1–P4 are done:
bounded terrain digging and hard-blocking moats; blocks/economy/save; the
soldier ring, larder and upgrades; and the real deterministic 90-second wave
night with edge spawns, click combat, weather, dawn results and soft-fail.
`test/hold-p4.js` guards the complete slice. Still to come per
`docs/HOLD-DESIGN.md`: clicker furniture and enemy types (P5), then balance
(P6). `ZS.Tiles` (`js/tiles.js`) owns the grid, nav marking, and render; the
scenario owns the rules.

Engine hooks the Hold needed (all opt-in, no-ops for the other pages):
`ZS_WW`/`ZS_WH` page sizing in `main.js`, the `terrain`/`drawGround`/
pointer hooks (contract table above), and null-water guards in
`world.build()` / `drawWater` (tile worlds have no river or lake).

## Style system (`js/sketch.js`)

- **Boil**: `ZS.setBoil(t)` sets the epoch; `ZS.jit(seed)` / `ZS.sjit(seed)`
  return a per-seed jitter for the current epoch — the "hand redrawing the
  lines" effect (~7 re-jit/s). Every wobbly shape takes a seed so it wiggles
  stably.
- **Primitives**: `wline` (jittered polyline), `wcirc` (wobbly circle),
  `wpoly` (wobbly polygon, optional fill), `sketchRect`, `lerpC` (color lerp).
- **Palette**: paper `#f3edde`, page body `#efe8d8`, ink `#3d342b`,
  ink-soft `rgba(61,52,43,0.5)`; landscape washes are low-alpha pastels
  (water `rgba(96,138,166,0.20)`, grass `rgba(122,148,84,0.10)`, trees
  `rgba(112,148,72,0.30)`, buildings tan). Keep new color in that register.

## Tooling & verification (how we work)

- **Format/lint** (Oxc): `npm run format` / `npm run lint` (or `npx oxfmt
  js/` / `npx oxlint js/ test/ tools/` in an interactive terminal). From
  non-TTY automation, run the local bins directly — `npx` can hang without a
  TTY: `node node_modules/oxfmt/bin/oxfmt js/` and
  `node node_modules/oxlint/bin/oxlint js/ test/ tools/` (stdin detached). No
  config files; Oxc defaults are the house style (e.g. it wraps long calls and
  adds trailing commas — don't hand-fight it). `.gitattributes` pins the
  tree to LF, so formatting the whole of `js/` no longer shows unrelated core
  files as modified (`ISSUES.md` #8).
- **`npm test` lints first.** A `<script src>` that fails to parse is skipped
  silently by the browser — the page still boots and the module is just
  missing from `ZS`, surfacing as a `TypeError` files away. `oxlint` catches
  that in milliseconds, and `tools/module-manifest.js` catches the other half:
  a module with no `<script>` tag on any page (`ISSUES.md` #14).
- **Browser tests: Playwright 1.62.1 (local devDependency).**
  `require("playwright")` from `D:/dev/zombie-sim` resolves; browsers live in
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%/ms-playwright` (builds use a `chrome-win64` subdir, not
  `chrome-win`). For performance work use **headed + `channel: "chrome"`**
  (the user's real browser with GPU); headless numbers run ~20–30% low.
  The shared headless browser tooling on this machine has document script
  execution disabled — never use it for JS verification.
- **Perf expectations** (RTX 4090 box): fit view (whole 3200×2400 world on
  screen, 910 agents) ≈ 40–50 fps; zoomed ≈ 144 fps (display-capped). The
  scene culls to the camera, so zoom level drives fps. Don't "fix" fit-view
  fps by culling agents — the look is the product.
- **Committed suites: `test/`** — the reusable Playwright checks, run with
  `npm test`. A guard nobody else can run is not a guard, so anything worth
  keeping goes here. See `test/README.md`.
- **Scratch area: `.verify/`** — gitignored. One-off diff scripts
  (`split-check.js` fidelity checker), fps probes, and screenshot *output*.
  One-offs get deleted after use; if a check turns out to be worth re-running,
  move it to `test/`.
- **`js.bak/`** — full pre-refactor backup (the single-module engine). Use it
  to diff behavior; delete it once the split is battle-tested.
- **Fidelity-check pattern** (for any future port/move of code): strip
  comments, whitespace, and trailing commas from both sides, extract the
  moved body, apply a map of the *intended* renames, and assert the old body
  is a substring of the new file. `.verify/split-check.js` is a working
  example.
- **Page-side inspection**: `ZS.debug` exposes `{ cam, world, nav,
  buildings, scenario }` — use it in `page.evaluate` for counts, camera
  state, and custom audits.

## Change recipes

- **Tune a behavior** → constants at the top of `js/scenarios/zombie.js`.
  Don't touch the core for scenario concerns.
- **New scenario** → copy `js/scenarios/zombie.js` (or `cannae.js` for a
  large-battle feel), rename the class, add a page that sets
  `var ZS_SCEN = "ScenarioName";` before the script tags (battle.html is the
  template — same tags, one line in `main.js` picks the class by name),
  reimplement the contract. Core stays untouched.
- **Core change** → keep it scenario-agnostic. If the core starts needing
  "is this a zombie?" knowledge, that's a signal to add a scenario callback
  (`hostile`/`walkBlocked`/`maxSpeed` are the precedent).
- **Moving code between files** → run the fidelity-check pattern afterward;
  "reimplemented from memory" is how bits silently drift (it already cost us
  a `fillBlob` radius and a color constant).

## Future work (known, not started)

Player control + vehicles. Design for it (the `ZS.debug` handle, the
walkability mask, and the generic draw/scenario split all exist for this)
but don't implement it yet. Whatever ships keeps the exact sketch style.
